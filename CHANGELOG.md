# Changelog

Notable changes to scripts, schema documentation, Make.com blueprints, audit tools, and project docs.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Upload pipeline** — Standardized Make send gate to **`Pending Link`** across 009/013/020/070a/070b; documented ladder in `make/documentation/upload-asset-engine.md`.
- **070a (v2.2)** — Requires `Pending Link` before send (matches 070b).
- **013 (v2.0), 020 (v2.0)** — Rewritten to production script standard: `main()` wrapper, CONFIG.version, standard outputs, docblock metadata (`Date Written` preserved, `Last Updated: 2026-06-22`).
- **070a (v2.2)** — Production docblock/GitHub header aligned to automation script standard.

### Added
- **`audit-stuck-upload-processing.js`** — Read-only extension audit for Processing-without-Drive and Ready gate mismatches.

### Fixed
- **072** — Build Weekly Summary Email Package no longer auto-checks `Send to Make?` after building email HTML; send is now manual.
- **010, 114, 101, 065, 054, 059** — XP Event create/update scripts now link `XP Events → Weekly Athlete Summary` using source-record link when available, with Enrollment + Week lookup fallback.
- **114 (v5.8)** — Video XP matching hardened with tiered lookup and submission/week conflict guards so a Video Feedback record cannot steal or reuse the wrong XP Event.
- **101 (v5.3)** — Zoom attendance supplemental re-runs no longer duplicate base XP when recording watchers are added after the original award; dedupe uses Source Key plus Zoom Meeting + Enrollment fallback.

### Added
- **`dedupe-zoom-meeting-xp-events.js`** — Safe-backfill extension script to find and remove duplicate Zoom Meeting XP Events (dry-run default).

### Changed
- **010** — Rewritten to production script standard (v10.3): `async function main()`, schema validation inside `main()`, required outputs, and final JSON console log.
- **114** — Rewritten to production script standard (v5.8): runtime state inside `main()`, try/catch inside `main()`, `await main()` runner; Weekly Athlete Summary linking hardened with schema validation and repair pass.
- **101** — Supplemental award mode (v5.3): `main()` wrapper, dual XP Event indexes, safe re-run for late recording watchers without resetting XP Award Status.
- **065** — Rewritten to production script standard (v9.2): runtime inside `main()`, `assertRequiredSchema()`, Weekly Athlete Summary schema validation and repair pass, standard outputs.
- **054** — Rewritten to production script standard (v5.4): module CONFIG/helpers, `assertRequiredSchema()`, Weekly Athlete Summary repair pass, standard outputs.
- **059** — Rewritten to production script standard (v3.5): module CONFIG/helpers, `assertRequiredSchema()`, Weekly Athlete Summary repair on create/duplicate paths, standard outputs.
