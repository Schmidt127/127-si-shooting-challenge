# Airtable Automation Capacity Ledger — DEV (corrected)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Base | `appTetnuCZlCZdTCT` (DEV) |
| Hard cap | **50** (ON + OFF both consume) |
| Ledger as-of | 2026-07-14 (S21 correction) |
| Stage | Analysis only — **no Airtable mutations** |
| Authority | Mike’s 50-item DEV list = current / required |

---

## Correction (binding)

| Rule | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **OFF ≠ obsolete** | Intentionally disabled for DEV/safety; remains required |
| **No delete because OFF** | Never recommend deletion from ON/OFF status |
| **Required until replaced** | Keep slot unless **explicit replacement** evidence (code + backlog) |
| **Capacity path** | Safe **consolidation** of required automations |
| **070a–078** | Required handoffs — often OFF by design; reassessed as **Keep / Combine**, not delete |

**Retracted from prior S21 Path B:** retire **061**, **078**, or any automation **because** it is OFF; using OFF email/upload slots as free capacity.

## Summary counts

| Milestone | Occupied | Free | How |
|-----------|----------|------|-----|
| Pre–Phase A | **50** | **0** | Mike |
| **After Phase A (COMPLETE)** | **50** | **0** | 006 deleted; 117 OFF created (net zero) |
| After Phase B (WAS trio) | **48** | **2** | 030∪032∪033 |
| After Phase C (063→020, 111→013) | **46** | **4** | Absorb copies |
| After Phase D (072∪074) | **45** | **5** | **Target met** |
| Stretch Phase E (076∪077 + more EMC) | ≤43 | ≥7 | Later |

| Metric | Value |
|--------|------:|
| Current count (post Phase A) | **50** (Mike: 006 gone, 117 present) |
| Proposed target (post Phase A–D) | **45** |
| Phase A slot delta | **0 net** |
| Deletions recommended for OFF status | **0** |

## Working 50 (required unless replaced)

Model used when full UI paste not yet filed: S21 reconciliation (docs ± known UI). Treat each as **required**. ON/OFF from Mike’s list when provided — status does not change disposition.

\*061/078: docs-table only / no GitHub file — still **required UI slots** until Mike authorizes fold into neighbors with tests; **not** deletable for OFF or missing GH.

**Not in Mike’s 50:** 008 (replaced by 116), 112 (Mike: not in DEV UI). Doc cleanup only.

## Safe consolidation groups (capacity math)

| Group | Members | Result shape | Slots freed | Timing / dependency risk | Rollback |
|-------|---------|--------------|------------:|--------------------------|----------|
| **A** | 006 + 021 | One Submissions prep | **+1** | Same table; low; must preserve 009 gate order | Re-split pastes |
| **B** | 030 + 032 + 033 | One WAS bootstrap | **+2** | Order-sensitive after 031 | Re-split three |
| **C** | 063 → into 020 | Drop separate 063 after 020 always writes GB | **+1** | Audit empty-GB HC rows first | Re-enable 063 |
| **D** | 111 → into 013 | Drop separate 111 after 013 always writes GB | **+1** | Audit empty-GB VF rows | Re-enable 111 |
| **E** | 072 + 074 | One weekly email path | **+1** | Make weekly; builders large | Re-split |
| **F** *(later)* | 076 + 077 | One daily email path | **+1** | Make daily | Re-split |
| **G** *(later)* | 071 + 073 + 075 → EMC | Fewer email autos | **+2–3** | C-011 registry; high regression | Per-email restore |
| **H** *(optional)* | 043 → into 042 | One level assigner | **+1** | **Replacement evidence only** (042 docblock + V2-014a) — not OFF | Re-paste 043 |
| **Blocked** | 070a/b/c + 022 | — | **0** | Upload/Make/Lambda order | — |
| **Blocked** | Delete any OFF | — | **0** | Violates Mike rule | — |

Hard **do-not-merge:** 041↔010 · 064↔065 · 113↔114 · 057↔058 · 070a↔070b↔070c↔022

## First migration phase (S22 — COMPLETE)

**Phase A COMPLETE 2026-07-14:** combined 021 live; smoke PASS; **006** deleted; **117 v1.0.0** OFF (blank webhook, no trigger yet).

**Next recommended:** Phase B — [`PHASE-B-WAS-bootstrap-plan.md`](../deploy-checklists/PHASE-B-WAS-bootstrap-plan.md) (030∪032∪033, +2 free).

## Path to ≥5 free after 117

| Step | Group | Δ | Free after 117 |
|------|-------|--:|---------------:|
| A | 006∪021 then +117 | 0 net | 0 |
| B | WAS 030∪032∪033 | +2 | 2 |
| C | 063→020 | +1 | 3 |
| D | 111→013 | +1 | 4 |
| E | 072∪074 | +1 | **5** ✓ |

## 070a–078 reassessment

| # | Role | Corrected disposition |
|---|------|------------------------|
| 070a | HW → Make/Lambda | Keep — intentional OFF when idle |
| 070b | Video → Make | Keep |
| 070c | Async verify | Keep — required for Accepted path |
| 071 | HW parent email | Keep; EMC later |
| 072 | Weekly build | Combine with 074 (Phase E) |
| 073 | VF parent email | Keep; EMC later |
| 074 | Weekly send | Combine with 072 (Phase E) |
| 075 | Welcome build | Keep; EMC later |
| 076 | Daily build | Combine with 077 later |
| 077 | Daily send | Combine with 076 later |
| 078 | Arm Parent Feedback Ready | Keep until proven redundant with 065 merge |

None of these free slots by remaining OFF.
