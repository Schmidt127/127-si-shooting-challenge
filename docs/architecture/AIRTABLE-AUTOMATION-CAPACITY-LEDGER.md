# Airtable Automation Capacity Ledger — DEV (corrected)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Base | `appTetnuCZlCZdTCT` (DEV) |
| Hard cap | **50** (ON + OFF both consume) |
| Ledger as-of | 2026-07-15 (Phase D COMPLETE) |
| Stage | Capacity tracking — Phase A–D executed in DEV |
| Authority | Mike’s 50-item DEV list = current / required |

---

## Correction (binding)

| Rule | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **OFF ≠ obsolete** | Intentionally disabled for DEV/safety; remains required |
| **No delete because OFF** | Never recommend deletion from ON/OFF status |
| **Required until replaced** | Keep slot unless **explicit replacement** evidence (code + backlog) |
| **Capacity path** | Safe **consolidation** of required automations |
| **070a–078** | Required handoffs — often OFF by design; reassessed as **Keep / Combine**, not delete |

**Retracted from prior S21 Path B:** retire **061**, **078**, or any automation **because** it is OFF; using OFF email/upload slots as free capacity.

## Summary counts

| Milestone | Occupied | Free | How |
|-----------|----------|------|-----|
| Pre–Phase A | **50** | **0** | Mike |
| **After Phase A (COMPLETE)** | **50** | **0** | 006 deleted; 117 OFF created (net zero) |
| **After Phase B (COMPLETE)** | **48 estimated** | **2 estimated** | Combined 030; **032** + **033** deleted. No visible Airtable counter — inventory math |
| **After Phase C1 (COMPLETE)** | **47 estimated** | **3 estimated** | Combined 020; **063** deleted (Mike UI) |
| **After Phase C2 (COMPLETE)** | **46 estimated** | **4 estimated** | Combined 013; **111** deleted (Mike UI 2026-07-15) |
| **After Phase D (COMPLETE)** | **45 estimated** | **5 estimated** | Combined 072; **074** deleted (Mike UI 2026-07-15). **Target met** |
| Stretch Phase E (076∪077 + more EMC) | ≤43 | ≥7 | Later |

| Metric | Value |
|--------|------:|
| Current count (post Phase D) | **45 estimated / 5 free estimated** (no visible Airtable counter; inventory − 032 − 033 − 063 − 111 − 074) |
| Proposed target (post Phase A–D) | **45** — **met** |
| Phase A slot delta | **0 net** |
| Deletions recommended for OFF status | **0** |

## Working 50 (required unless replaced)

Model used when full UI paste not yet filed: S21 reconciliation (docs ± known UI). Treat each as **required**. ON/OFF from Mike’s list when provided — status does not change disposition.

\*061/078: docs-table only / no GitHub file — still **required UI slots** until Mike authorizes fold into neighbors with tests; **not** deletable for OFF or missing GH.

**Not in Mike’s 50:** 008 (replaced by 116), 112 (Mike: not in DEV UI). Doc cleanup only.

## Safe consolidation groups (capacity math)

| Group | Members | Result shape | Slots freed | Timing / dependency risk | Rollback |
|-------|---------|--------------|------------:|--------------------------|----------|
| **A** | 006 + 021 | One Submissions prep | **+1** | Same table; low; must preserve 009 gate order | Re-split pastes |
| **B** | 030 + 032 + 033 | One WAS bootstrap | **+2** | Order-sensitive after 031 | Re-split three |
| **C** | 063 → into 020 | Drop separate 063 after 020 always writes GB | **+1** | Audit empty-GB HC rows first | Re-enable 063 |
| **D** | 111 → into 013 | Drop separate 111 after 013 always writes GB | **+1** | Audit empty-GB VF rows | Re-enable 111 |
| **E** | 072 + 074 | One weekly email path | **+1** | Make weekly; builders large | Re-split |
| **F** *(later)* | 076 + 077 | One daily email path | **+1** | Make daily | Re-split |
| **G** *(later)* | 071 + 073 + 075 → EMC | Fewer email autos | **+2–3** | C-011 registry; high regression | Per-email restore |
| **H** *(optional)* | 043 → into 042 | One level assigner | **+1** | **Replacement evidence only** (042 docblock + V2-014a) — not OFF | Re-paste 043 |
| **Blocked** | 070a/b/c + 022 | — | **0** | Upload/Make/Lambda order | — |
| **Blocked** | Delete any OFF | — | **0** | Violates Mike rule | — |

## 070a–078 reassessment

| # | Role | Corrected disposition |
|---|------|------------------------|
| 070a | HW → Make/Lambda | Keep — intentional OFF when idle |
| 070b | Video → Make | Keep |
| 070c | Async verify | Keep — required for Accepted path |
| 071 | HW parent email | Keep; EMC later |
| 072 | Weekly build (+ send) | Combined — Phase D COMPLETE |
| 073 | VF parent email | Keep; EMC later |
| 074 | Weekly send | **LIBRARY** — deleted; absorbed by 072 |
| 075 | Welcome build | Keep; EMC later |
| 076 | Daily build | Combine with 077 later |
| 077 | Daily send | Combine with 076 later |
| 078 | Arm Parent Feedback Ready | Keep until proven redundant with 065 merge |

None of these free slots by remaining OFF.
