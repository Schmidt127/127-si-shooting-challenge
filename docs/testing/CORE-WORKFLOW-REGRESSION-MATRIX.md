# Core Workflow Regression Matrix

**Status:** Authoritative human matrix (docs-only)  
**Stage:** S26 · Workstream 4  
**As-of:** 2026-07-15 (S29)  
**Bases:** DEV `appTetnuCZlCZdTCT` · PROD `appn84sqPw03zEbTT`  
**Companion JSON:** [core-workflow-regression-matrix.json](./core-workflow-regression-matrix.json)

**Authority sources:** [automation-index](../automation-index.md) · [AIRTABLE-AUTOMATION-INVENTORY](../architecture/AIRTABLE-AUTOMATION-INVENTORY.md) · [DEPENDENCY-MAP](../architecture/AIRTABLE-AUTOMATION-DEPENDENCY-MAP.md) · [PROJECT_STATE](../PROJECT_STATE.md) · Phase A/B/C smoke results · [C-024 dedupe inventory](../deploy-checklists/C-024-dedupe-field-inventory-stage2.md)

## How to use this matrix

1. Pick a **workflow** before any consolidation paste, season rollover rehearsal, or pre-season dry-run.
2. Confirm **prerequisites** and **live fixture** (Schmidt only for live writes).
3. Run the listed path; record evidence against **expected result**.
4. On failure, use **rollback/restore** before continuing adjacent workflows.
5. Update **Evidence status** in this doc + JSON when fresh smoke lands.

### Evidence status vocabulary

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **PASS** / **live DEV passing** | Documented live DEV (or PROD where noted) smoke with artifact path |
| **automated and passing** | Offline/unit contracts green in repo |
| **UNKNOWN** | Scripts/docs exist; no current authoritative live smoke for this matrix row |
| **PLANNED** / **planned** | Design / harness ready; intentionally not run yet |
| **blocked by Mike UI** | Paste, enable, rename, or delete required before live run |
| **blocked by external service** | Make / Lambda / email / webhook dependency |

### S29 high-risk focus rows

| Workflow | Autos | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Combined **072** weekly email | 072 | **live DEV passing** — Phase D no-send · **074 retired** |
| **117** × **101** double-award / keys | 117, 101 | **automated and passing** offline · live **blocked by Mike UI** (117 remains OFF) |
| **022** child writeback | 022 | Identity confirmed · rename **blocked by Mike UI** (optional) |
| Public athlete profile | web | **automated and passing** (mock adapter) |

### S27 high-risk focus rows

| Workflow | Autos | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Combined **021** attachment + video count | 021 | **live DEV passing** — Phase A smoke |
| Combined **030** WAS bootstrap | 030 | **live DEV passing** — Phase B smoke |
| Combined **020** HC + GB | 020 | **live DEV passing** — Phase C1 post-paste |
| Combined **013** VF + GB | 013 | **live DEV passing** — Phase C2 post-paste |
| **117** × **101** double-award / keys | 117, 101 | **automated and passing** offline · live **blocked by Mike UI** (117 OFF) |
| Phase D weekly email no-send | 072 v4 | **live DEV passing** (S28) · **074 deleted** |

### Global constraints (this matrix)

- **No PROD writes** unless Mike explicitly opens a PROD window.
- **No real-family email / SMS.**
- **Do not enable 117** until Mike activation package is authorized.
- Prefer **Schmidt Testing** enrollment `recgP9qZYjAhE7NXm` for fixtures.
- After Phase consolidations, prefer **combined** scripts (021, 030, 020, 013) over deleted library siblings (006, 032/033, 063, 111 pending delete).

## W1 — Enrollment

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Workflow ID** | `enrollment` |
| **Trigger** | Enrollment enters intake view / enrollment create-update (confirm live 001–003 views in Airtable UI — docs conditions may be swapped vs GitHub) |
| **Prerequisites** | Fillout (or equivalent) enrollment payload; Athletes table writable; Grade Bands populated for season; Program Instance not required today (pre–V2-013) |
| **Primary automations** | **001** find/create Athlete + link · **002** assign Grade Band initial · **003** Grade Band if Grade changes / refresh needed |
| **Outputs** | Athlete linked on Enrollment; Grade Band set; optional welcome path via **075** |
| **Dedupe key** | Athlete identity match (001 find-or-create); Enrollment is canonical season participant row |
| **Retry** | Re-run 001/002/003 on same Enrollment after fixing missing athlete/band; scripts should skip when already linked/correct |
| **Adjacent autos** | Downstream consumers of Grade Band: **030** (WAS), **020** (HC after C1), **013** (VF after C2), **113**, **023** enrollment-on-submission, **075** welcome |
| **Live fixture** | Schmidt Testing Enrollment `recgP9qZYjAhE7NXm` — do **not** create new production enrollments for regression |
| **Expected result** | Athlete linked; Grade Band matches grade; no duplicate Athlete for same identity |
| **Rollback / restore** | Unlink mistaken Athlete only on test enrollments; restore Grade Band from Enrollment.Grade; do not delete Athletes shared with history |
| **Evidence status** | **UNKNOWN** — Folder 01 investigation open (S26); no Phase A–C smoke covers 001–003 |
| **Evidence paths** | [DEPENDENCY-MAP § Folder 01](../architecture/AIRTABLE-AUTOMATION-DEPENDENCY-MAP.md) · inventory notes on 001/002 condition swap |

| **Dedupe key** | Submission Duplicate Key (**007**); XP `SUBMISSION\|{submissionId}` (**010**); **009** skips same attachment id on same submission |
| **Retry** | Safe to re-touch Submission when statuses empty / assets missing; **021** idempotent (Phase A smoke); do not clear terminal Sent statuses casually |
| **Adjacent autos** | **031** WAS · **013**/**020** asset fan-out · **041** level recalc from XP · streaks **055**/**053** |
| **Live fixture** | Phase A examples: `recS6KgsiWrpXpau0` (video), `recgPS8m1y2ISmxQK` (HW), `recW4CvqDTVZvrBQH` (both); Schmidt enrollment filter |
| **Expected result** | Fillout-shaped row flows 023→005→021→009→010 without duplicate assets; video count correct; Sent preserved on retest |
| **Rollback / restore** | `_rollback/phase-a-006-021-2026-07-14/` for 021 script; delete only Schmidt-owned test Submissions/Assets; restore Upload Status if smoke left rows dirty |
| **Evidence status** | **PASS** — Phase A combined **021** live smoke (2026-07-14). Full end-to-end Fillout intake including **010** milestone path: **PLANNED** via **115** / C-020 |

## W6 — Levels

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Workflow ID** | `levels` |
| **Trigger** | XP Events → **041** mark Enrollment for recalc; Enrollment flagged → **042** assign Current/Next Level + gate blocking; **043** set Level Gate Rule from Next Level (consolidation candidate into **042** — do not retire without replacement evidence) |

## Cross-cutting fixture & safety

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Canonical test Enrollment** | `recgP9qZYjAhE7NXm` — `Schmidt, Testing - 2025-2026` |
| **Testing views** | Filter by Enrollment link (C-019) — not pipeline test flags |
| **Config tables** | Do not add test rows to Levels, Gates, XP Rules, Weeks, Milestones |
| **External systems** | Make / Lambda / S3 only on Schmidt paths; leave send automations OFF when idle |
| **Capacity note** | After Phase C1: DEV ~47 estimated / 3 free until **111** delete; **117** OFF occupies a slot |

---

## Suggested regression order (safe)

1. **W2** submission prep (**021**/**009**) — already PASS recently  
2. **W3** WAS bootstrap (**031**/**030**) — PASS  
3. **W4** homework link (**020**) — PASS; upload only under Mike  
4. **W5** video link (**013**) — PASS; upload/email gated  
5. **W1** enrollment — UNKNOWN (docs investigation first)  
6. **W6** levels — UNKNOWN (after controlled XP)  
7. **W7** achievements — PLANNED after Fillout-shaped submission via **115**  
8. **W8** Zoom **101** only — UNKNOWN; **117** remains OFF
